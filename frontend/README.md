# flynt-test

## Dependencies

```bash
# react-router-dom
used on links and redirection

# react-form
clean form system

# yum
validate our data forms
```

## Further steps

Add editing user with forms

Use context to store api calls (for users in e.g.)

Split our api calls on specific folder

Clean components arborescence with good practices

Split with micro components (users page in e.g.)

Transform the complete app on scss use tailwind instead of bootstrap, or even more, use styled components (just used to Users/Teams page)

Add React Testing Library, storybook

Add i18n for translations

Add lazy loading

Add theming

## Troubleshooting

First time using React form

First time using React on typescript so some "any" still present
